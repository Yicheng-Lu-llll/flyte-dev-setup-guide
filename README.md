# Setting Sail with Flyte: A Beginners Guide to Dev Environment Setup

If you're reading this, you likely have an interest in Flyte, an open-source data, ML, and infrastructure orchestrator that simplifies the creation, scaling, and maintenance of concurrent workflows. Like many in the open-source community, you might be eager to contribute but find the initial setup process a daunting hurdle.

This experience is quite common for newcomers‚ÄîI too struggled with the setup when I first started contributing (many thanks to Kevin Su for all his help!). Building a strong Flyte community, where everyone feels welcome to participate, requires us to break down these barriers and make the contribution process more accessible. With this goal in mind, I've written this guide as a supplement to the official resources. It aims to provide a clear and simple, step-by-step approach to setting up a local development environment, reflecting the latest updates and modifications. It especially simplifies the setup for features that involve multiple components.

So, let's embark on this journey together, easing your transition into the world of Flyte contributions.

## How to set dev environment for flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, flytepropeller?

#### 1. install [Flytectl](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytectl), a portable and lightweight command-line interface to work with Flyte.
```shell
# Step1: Install the latest version of Flytectl
curl -sL https://ctl.flyte.org/install | bash
# flyteorg/flytectl info checking GitHub for latest tag
# flyteorg/flytectl info found version: 0.6.39 for v0.6.39/Linux/x86_64
# flyteorg/flytectl info installed ./bin/flytectl

# Step2: Export Flytectl path based on the previous log "flyteorg/flytectl info installed ./bin/flytectl"
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/bin # replace with your path
```

#### 2. Build a k3s cluster that runs Minio and Postgres pods.
[minio](https://min.io/) is an S3-compatible object store that will be used later to store task output, input, etc.  
[postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open-source object-relational database that will later be used by flyteadmin to store all Flyte information.

```shell
# Step1: Start k3s cluster, create pods for Postgres and Minio. Note: We cannot access Flyte UI yet! but we can access the Minio console now.
flytectl demo start --dev
# üë®‚Äçüíª Flyte is ready! Flyte UI is available at http://localhost:30080/console üöÄ üöÄ üéâ 
# ‚ùáÔ∏è Run the following command to export demo environment variables for accessing flytectl
#         export FLYTECTL_CONFIG=/home/ubuntu/.flyte/config-sandbox.yaml 
# üêã Flyte sandbox ships with a Docker registry. Tag and push custom workflow images to localhost:30000
# üìÇ The Minio API is hosted on localhost:30002. Use http://localhost:30080/minio/login for Minio console

# Step2: Export FLYTECTL_CONFIG as the previous log indicated.
FLYTECTL_CONFIG=/home/ubuntu/.flyte/config-sandbox.yaml

# Step3: The kubeconfig will be automatically copied to the user's main kubeconfig (default is `~/.kube/config`) with "flyte-sandbox" as the context name.
# Check that we can access the K3s cluster. Verify that Postgres and Minio are running.
kubectl get pod -n flyte
# NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# flyte-sandbox-docker-registry-85745c899d-dns8q        1/1     Running   0          5m
# flyte-sandbox-kubernetes-dashboard-6757db879c-wl4wd   1/1     Running   0          5m
# flyte-sandbox-proxy-d95874857-2wc5n                   1/1     Running   0          5m
# flyte-sandbox-minio-645c8ddf7c-sp6cc                  1/1     Running   0          5m
# flyte-sandbox-postgresql-0                            1/1     Running   0          5m
```

#### 3. [Optional] Access the Minio console via http://localhost:30080/minio/login.  
The default Username is `minio` and the default Password is `miniostorage`. You might need to look at input.pb, output.pb or deck.html, etc in Minio when you are developing.
 
#### 4. Run all backends(flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, flytepropeller) and HTTP Server in a single binary 
```shell
# Step1: Download flyte repo
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte.git
cd flyte

# Step2: Build a single binary that bundles all the backends (flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, flytepropeller) and HTTP Server.
# The versions of flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, and flytepropeller used to build the single binary are defined in `go.mod`.
sudo apt-get -y install jq # You may need to install jq
go mod tidy
sudo make compile

# Step3: Running the single binary. `flyte_local.yaml` is the config file. It is written to fit all your previous builds. So, you don't need to change `flyte_local.yaml`.
# Note: Replace `flyte_local.yaml` with file in this PR:https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/3808. Once it is merged, there is no need to change.
# Note: You may encounter an error due to database `flyteadmin` does not exists. Run the command again will solve the problem.
flyte start --config flyte_local.yaml
# All logs from flyteadmin, flyteplugins, flytepropeller, etc. will appear in the terminal.
```

#### 5. [Optional] Access the Flyte UI at http://localhost:30080/console.
   
#### 6. Build single binary with your own code. 
The following instructions assume that you'll change flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, and flytepropeller simultaneously (features that involve multiple components).
If you don't need to change some components, simply ignore the instruction for that component.
```shell
# Step1: Modify the source code for flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, and flytepropeller.

# Step2: Flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, and flytepropeller use go1.19, so make sure to switch to go1.19.
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
go install golang.org/dl/go1.19@latest
go1.19 download
export GOROOT=$(go1.19 env GOROOT)
export PATH="$GOROOT/bin:$PATH"


# Step3.1: In the flyteidl folder, before building the single binary, you should run:
make lint
make generate

# Step3.2: In the flyteadmin folder, before building the single binary, you should run:
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller=/home/ubuntu/flytepropeller #replace with your own local path to flytepropeller
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteidl=/home/ubuntu/flyteidl #replace with your own local path to flyteidl
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteplugins=/home/ubuntu/flyteplugins # replace with your own local path to flyteplugins
make lint
make generate
make test_unit

# Step3.3: In the flyteplugins folder, before building the single binary, you should run:
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteidl=/home/ubuntu/flyteidl #replace with your own local path to flyteidl

# Step3.4: In the flytepropeller folder, before building the single binary, you should run:
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteidl=/home/ubuntu/flyteidl #replace with your own local path to flyteidl
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteplugins=/home/ubuntu/flyteplugins # replace with your own local path to flyteplugins
make lint
make generate
make test_unit

# Step4: Now, you can build the single binary. In the Flyte folder, run `go mod edit -replace`. This will replace the code with your own.
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin=/home/ubuntu/flyteadmin #replace with your own local path to flyteadmin
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller=/home/ubuntu/flytepropeller #replace with your own local path to flytepropeller
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteidl=/home/ubuntu/flyteidl #replace with your own local path to flyteidl
go mod edit -replace github.com/flyteorg/flyteplugins=/home/ubuntu/flyteplugins # replace with your own local path to flyteplugins

# Step5: Rebuild and rerun the single binary based on your own code.
go mod tidy
sudo make compile
flyte start --config flyte_local.yaml
```

#### 7. Test it by running a Hello World workflow.
```shell
# Step1: Install flytekit
pip install flytekit && export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin

# Step2: The flytesnacks repository provides a lot of useful examples.
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks && cd flytesnacks/cookbook

# Step3: Before running the Hello World workflow, create the flytesnacks-development namespace. 
# This is necessary because, by default (without creating a new project), task pods will run in the flytesnacks-development namespace.
kubectl create namespace flytesnacks-development

# Step4: Run a Hello World example
pyflyte run --remote core/flyte_basics/hello_world.py my_wf
# Go to http://localhost:30080/console/projects/flytesnacks/domains/development/executions/fd63f88a55fed4bba846 to see execution in the console.
```
   
#### 8. Tear down the k3s cluster After finishing developing.
```shell
flytectl demo teardown
# context removed for "flyte-sandbox".
# üßπ üßπ Sandbox cluster is removed successfully.
# ‚ùáÔ∏è Run the following command to unset sandbox environment variables for accessing flytectl
#        unset FLYTECTL_CONFIG 
```


## How to set dev environment for flytekit?

#### 1. Set local Flyte Cluster
If you also change the code for flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins or flytepropeller, you can refer to `How to set dev environment for flyteidl, flyteadmin, flyteplugins, flytepropeller?` to build the backends.
If not, we can start backends in one command.
```shell
# Step1: Create backends. It will set up a k3s cluster that runs Minio, Postgres pods and all Flyte components: flyteadmin, flyteplugins, flytepropeller, etc.
flytectl demo start
# üë®‚Äçüíª Flyte is ready! Flyte UI is available at http://localhost:30080/console üöÄ üöÄ üéâ 
# ‚ùáÔ∏è Run the following command to export demo environment variables for accessing flytectl
#         export FLYTECTL_CONFIG=/home/ubuntu/.flyte/config-sandbox.yaml 
# üêã Flyte sandbox ships with a Docker registry. Tag and push custom workflow images to localhost:30000
# üìÇ The Minio API is hosted on localhost:30002. Use http://localhost:30080/minio/login for Minio console
```

#### 2. Run workflow locally
```shell
# Step1: Build virtual environment to develop Flytekit. It will allow your local changes to take effect when the same Python interpreter runs import flytekit
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit.git # replace with your own repo
cd flytekit
virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/flytekit
source ~/.virtualenvs/flytekit/bin/activate
make setup
pip install -e .
pip install gsutil awscli

# Step2: Modify the source code for flytekit and run unit test and lint.
make lint
make test

# Step3: run an sample to test locally
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks
cd flytesnacks/cookbook
python3 core/flyte_basics/hello_world.py
# Running my_wf() hello world

```

#### 3. Run workflow in sandbox
Before running workflow in sandbox, You should make sure you can run workflow locally.
To run workflow in sandbox, We need to build the flyekit image. The following Dockerfile is the minum setting to run a task. 
You can refer to how the [officail flitekit image](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/Dockerfile) is built to add more componnents(like plugins) if you need to.
Please make the following Dockerfile under your flytekit folder.
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster
USER root
WORKDIR /root
ENV PYTHONPATH /root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install build-essential -y
RUN apt-get install git -y
RUN pip install -U git+https://github.com/Yicheng-Lu-llll/flytekit.git@real-time-deck-support
ENV FLYTE_INTERNAL_IMAGE "yichenglu/flytekit:MetricsExploration19"
```
The following instautions tells how to build the image, push the image to Flyte Cluster and finally Submit workflow to Flyte Cluster.
```shell
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
export FLYTECTL_CONFIG=/root/.flyte/config-sandbox.yaml
export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG:/root/.kube/config:/root/.flyte/k3s/k3s.yaml

# Step1: make sure to push your change to the remote repo
# In flytekit folder
git add . && git commit -s -m "develop" && git push

# Step2: build the image
export FLYTE_INTERNAL_IMAGE="localhost:30000/flytekit:visualization-continue23"
docker build --no-cache -t  "${FLYTE_INTERNAL_IMAGE}" -f /home/ubuntu/flytekit/Dockerfile .


# Step3: push the image to Flyte Cluster
docker push ${FLYTE_INTERNAL_IMAGE}

# Step4: Submit workflow to Flyte Cluster
git clone https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks
cd flytesnacks/cookbook
pyflyte run --image ${FLYTE_INTERNAL_IMAGE} --remote core/flyte_basics/hello_world.py  my_wf

```





## How to set dev environment for flyteconsole?

```shell
# Step1: Clone the repo cd to the flyteconsole folder
https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole.git
cd flyteconsole

# Step2: Install yarn and

# Step3: Start the server
yarn build:types
yarn run build:prod
export BASE_URL=/console
export ADMIN_API_URL=http://localhost:30081
export DISABLE_AUTH=1
export ADMIN_API_USE_SSL="http"
```
